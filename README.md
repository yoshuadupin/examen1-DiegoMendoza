# Auth with React Router V4 and Firebase V3

*Using React 16.1.1, React Router 4, and Firebase 4.6.0*

CRA was used to setup this project so you might wanna go to [CRA's docs](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md) to check how to setup other tools or just change configuration.
